Tweets of Congress is my attempt to collate the entirety of Congress' daily Twitter output using an automated process that checks Twitter on a fixed interval. Archives are available on this site and in JSON form. You can find JSON datasets linked in posts or in this site's [Github repo](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}/congresstweets). Due to size constraints, archives are limited to the past 15 days. This site is open-source, so feel free to fork or whatever to your heart's content. For any issues or other feedback, file an issue in the repo or [send me an email](mailto:alexlitelATgmailDOTcom).

This site is built on [John Otander's Pixyll theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).
